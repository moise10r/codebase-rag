# CodeBase RAGBot 

## What is CodeBase RAGBot?

CodeBase RAGBot is an innovative tool that transforms how developers understand and interact with codebases. By combining the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models, it creates an intuitive chat interface for exploring and understanding GitHub repositories. Simply provide a repository URL, and CodeBase RAGBot will analyze the codebase, understand its structure, and allow you to ask questions in natural language. Whether you're a new developer trying to understand a project, or an experienced programmer looking to quickly navigate complex codebases, CodeBase RAGBot acts as your intelligent coding companion, providing context-aware answers and insights about the code.

Unlike traditional code search tools, CodeBase RAGBot understands the context and relationships within the code, allowing it to provide more meaningful and comprehensive answers. It can explain code functionality, suggest improvements, identify patterns, and help you understand how different parts of the codebase interact with each other. This makes it an invaluable tool for code review, onboarding, and maintaining large projects.

## Features
